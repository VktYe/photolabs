# Photolabs

The PhotoLabs is a single-page React application developed as part of the Web Development React course. It allows users to browse, view, and interact with photos pulled from an API, organized by categories called "topics."

The backend and PostgreSQL database were pre-configured by Lighthouse Labs. My primary focus was developing the frontend using React, building out the component architecture, handling state management, and integrating it with the backend API to display real data.

In addition to the core features, I also implemented an extra feature: users can click on a similar photo inside the modal to load that photo dynamically â€” including its own similar photos.



## Features
- Browse all photos from the homepage

- Filter photos by topic using the navigation bar

- Click on a photo to view a larger version and its related photos

- Like and unlike photos across views

- View liked photo count in the heart icon in the navbar

- Proxy setup with Vite to handle API requests cleanly

- Bonus: Click on similar photos inside the modal to view full details and load new related photos
